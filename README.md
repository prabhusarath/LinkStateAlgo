# LinkStateAlgo
Dijkstra's Algorithm written in java.

With Input as Any File Location with Network Cost
(Example is Added).

Other Options like Creating Connection Table,Shortest Path, Deleting Node from Network has Been Added.

A Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm should be applied to find shortest path between two entities: source and destination nodes and the minimum cost to travel from source to destination. Link state routing has been implemented in JAVA using NetBeans IDE.


Input file containing the network information will be loaded, Shortest path is calculated from the router , Implemented code finds out all those possibilities for a given network and will display only last calculated path for the connection table interfaces and then finds out the optimal path between two selected routers (source and destination nodes) .
